B) <a id="second_step">Writing a Resume in Markdown</a>

This section is intended to help guide you through building your resume. It is rather short compared to the rest as this is not truly the focus of this guide. Instead, this will simply try to give you the tools and couple helpful tips for making the conversion easier.

  1. Plan how you want your resume to look. If you have one written in another format, break it up into chunks and pick the order you want it to be read in. Otherwise, start by laying out the basics like work experience, skills, and any other info you think might be relevant.
  2. Write the basic info in the order you want and identify the main sections and headers.
  3. Using [this guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) adjust the formatting to fit what you believe to be important.
